# Coffee Shop Sales Data Analytics Project

## Project Overview
Coffee Shop Sales Transaction records for Maven Roasters, a fictitious coffee shop operating out of three NYC locations. The dataset includes the transaction date, timestamp, and location, along with product-level details.

## Stakeholder Questions
**Q1. How have Maven Roasters' sales trended over time?**

**Q2. Which days of the week tend to be busiest, and why do you think that's the case?**

**Q3. Which products are sold most and least often? Which drive the most revenue for the business?**

## Insights
### Sales Trend Over Time
From the start of the year, the journey has been one of continuous growth. In January, the sales stood at $81,677, a strong start fueled by the New Year’s resolutions and the chilly weather driving customers to seek comfort in warm beverages. As the months progressed, we noticed an uptrend, culminating in a remarkable $166,485 in June.

### Busiest Days of the Week
Data revealed that Fridays are the busiest days of the week. This isn't just a coincidence but rather a reflection of customers' lifestyles. As the last working day, Friday carries the anticipation of the weekend. Many customers choose to unwind after their workweek with a visit to Maven.

### Product Popularity and Revenue Drivers
Diving into product-level details, it’s clear that the Barista Espresso stands out as the star performer. Not only is it the most sold product, but it also drives the most revenue for the business. Brewed Black Tea sees fewer sales.

## Tools Used
To uncover these insights, I leveraged the powerful combination of Excel and Power Query. Excel allowed me to perform detailed analysis, while Power Query transformed raw data into a structured format, enabling me to extract meaningful patterns and trends.
